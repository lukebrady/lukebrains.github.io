        <h3>Welcome to my personal website. It is great to have you here!</h3>
        <p>This website is dedicated to talking about a plethora of topics
            such as projects I am working on or just random things that happen to be on my mind.
            I encourage you to take a look around this website and let me know where I can make
            improvements. All of the projects I work on will be listed here and I encourage anyone who
            is interested to improve my code and make a pull request.<br/><br/>
            At this point you may be asking yourself a few questions, such as:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><i>Who is this guy?</i></li>
            <li><i>Why does this website look like it came from the 90s?</i></li>
            <li><i>Why should I care about his open-source projects?</i></li>
        </ol>
